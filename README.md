## learning_ml

Learning ML has a few requirements, one has to be able to do basic maths, specially calculus, linear algebra, vectors, etc.

I've done a good amount of maths when I was back in university, but I'm a little rusty now. I no longer remember most of things and I must brush up on those.

First I'm gonna go through a little vectors, Implementing dot products, magnitute etc. While doing it, I'll be creating a package which will contain everything.

I don't want to remember the mathematical formulae, I'll implement stuff in python and if I do need the mathematical formulae, I can always check implementation.

I'll document each and everything as I go through in this repository, including formulae and docs, (I might also add jupyter notebook and document how we can use that package)

Endgoal is to learn ML, know maths and prepare myself to deep learning.

I'll try to keep code as readable as possible. I'll be using numpy heavily, but that shouldn't be a problem because whatever I do, I'll document in the process.

I use PyCharm IDE to save myself some time, (just typing `numpy.` and being able to see list of methods, rather than going to docs, already saves me time)
